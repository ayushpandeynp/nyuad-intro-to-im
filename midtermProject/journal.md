# Mid-term Project Journal
I still need to figure out what would be an interesting name for the project - might be something like sailing in the Pacific or just boating in Pokhara (amazing place in my home country where you can enjoy boating on lakes with a wonderful view of mountains).

The game would be about sailing a ship/boat in the ocean/lake and trying to successfully avoid obstacles such as dolphins, sharks, or pirates (in case there's ocean).

## Progress
For now, I've been making my mind about what elements to include in the game and have also been collecting some sprites and backgrounds. I will start working on the code this weekend.

### Feb 19
I wanted to give a vibe of ocean/lake to the game. So, I started searching for free music on the web. I finally found a suitable background music called 'Deep Blue' by Benjamin Tissot from [this website.](https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/deep-blue)

### Feb 20
I was thinking that the main character of the game would be a boat, so I looked for boat sprites and found something that could fit with other elements. The image is added into the ```images``` folder.

### Feb 21
The game also needs a good background image, so I tried searching for a good marine background. I ended up being satisfied with one, but it might change. I was also wondering how to introduce an enemy to the game. For now, I've thought of bringing the shark every 10 seconds. To do it, I'll probably be using both ```frameRate()``` and ```frameCount``` in Processing. I found an amazing sprite for the shark and tweaked it a little in Photoshop.

### Feb 22
The main character would also have to rotate towards the direction where the boat/ship is supposed to move. So, I reviewed the ```rotate()``` function in Processing to be more familiar with it. At this point, I am rethinking of the main character. Boat sounds childish, why not add an entire ship? But I need to find a good sprite for it, otherwise I might end up creating my own.

To be continued...
