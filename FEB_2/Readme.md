# Ripple and Grid Steps
The following art is inspired from the Grid example practised in class. I have tried to implement a ripple effect using ellipses in Processing. It takes the mouse position and generates a ripple at the same position also building grid steps from top left to the mouse position.

### Output

### Process
For the ripple-like effect, I first initialized radius and offset values for the ellipses. Then, I added the ellipse shapes having no fill but stroke. The radius and offset are incremented and as soon as it reaches to a certain max value, they're decreased again. So, it works like an effect similar to ripples.

### Interesting
I was able to use the same grid layout explained in the class, tweak it a little bit and create grid steps.

Thank you!
