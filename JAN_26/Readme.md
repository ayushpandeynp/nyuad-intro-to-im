# Self Portrait
My portrait avatar created in Processing.

### Process
First, I asked my suitemate to take a picture of me working on my laptop. Then I used the built-in shapes in Processing to mock the same image like a graphic avatar.

### Difficulty
**Perfect Positioning** - To position the shapes to correct co-ordinates, I had to do trial and test multiple times.

### What's interesting?
One interesting element I was able to add is the laptop-on-table layout, with my laptop's brand name.

Thank you!
